# QuickToken Deployment Integration Todo List

## Priority Items

1. **Fix Admin Dashboard Token Display**
   - Issue: Successfully deployed tokens are stored in Supabase but not appearing in the admin dashboard
   - Verification: Confirmed working deployment on Sepolia (TX: 0x188b86edd56508e460bd7ba218cdf25238b497cbe5e8c39581550aa3d12339e4)
   - Verification: Confirmed Supabase record exists (ID: bde65d8c-8d1e-42ac-a24e-499b976120f8)
   - Possible causes:
     - Dashboard query filter not matching deployed tokens
     - Network filtering issue (only showing specific networks)
     - Missing client_id relationship in Supabase
   - Action: Review dashboard-to-Supabase integration code in quicktoken-kit-web

2. **Test DApp Token Deployment Flow**
   - Issue: Previous version passed Hardhat tests but failed in 20 consecutive DApp deployments
   - Goal: Verify ethers.js v6 compatibility throughout the entire deployment flow
   - Action: Test end-to-end deployment from DApp UI to contract deployment

## Future Improvements

3. **Enhance Verification Process**
   - Current issue: Etherscan verification sometimes fails when running immediately after deployment
   - Action: Add retry mechanism with increasing wait times for verification
   - Action: Add specific error handling for "contract bytecode not yet available" errors

4. **Gas Price Optimization**
   - Current implementation: Using 10% buffer on current gas price
   - Action: Make buffer configurable based on network congestion
   - Action: Add EIP-1559 fee logic for networks that support it

5. **Deployment Status Tracking**
   - Current implementation: Basic tracking in Supabase
   - Action: Add deployment status updates at each stage (initiated, pending, confirmed, verified)
   - Action: Add transaction confirmation tracking (1/3/5 confirmations)

6. **Error Recovery & Reporting**
   - Action: Implement detailed error logging for deployment failures
   - Action: Create deployment retry mechanism for recoverable errors
   - Action: Add email notifications for critical failures

## Technical Debt

7. **Update Supabase Schema**
   - Current issue: Missing columns for tracking verification status
   - Action: Add verification_status column to tokens table
   - Action: Add platform_address and platform_fee_percentage columns

8. **Code Cleanup**
   - Action: Remove redundant code in deploy.js and deploy-with-tracking.js
   - Action: Abstract common functionality into shared utility functions
   - Action: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for all deployment functions
